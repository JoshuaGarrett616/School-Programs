This program takes in a file called lowercase.txt which holds the entire dictionary and
orders it into graphs in which nodes are connected by the words being one letter apart.
For example, boat would be an adjacent node to boar. This program determines if there is
a path between 2 words entered by the user, such as boat to real. If there is a path,
the program will display the words it went through to complete the traversal, if
there is not a path, the program will the the user that there is no path.
