This program takes a text file called data3, which displays graphs by having a node
in fornt and the numbers next to it being its adjacent nodes. Graphs are separated
by a blank line. This program makes use of BFS and lists by deciding if a graph is
connected or not and if the graph is not connected it displays how many components
there are to a file called out3.
